# Hey 👋

Welcome to my little corner on the Internet.

My Name is Sawant Sahil Ashok. I'm from Mumbai, Maharashtra, INDIA

`👨‍💻   Also visit me on : [aaj-mai-uddenga] for my other corner on Internet`

I am a LINUX Entthusiast, and a Programmer, and a man of Computer and Machines. I spend my weekends tinkering on my mini-Projects, concerning Python Scripting and as well as BLOG writing. The Links for my PROJECTS and BLOGS are provided above. I also have attraction for watching ANIME, and tinkering with my PERSONAL RASPBERRY-PI.

I usually work only on my Three Devices, namely:

- MUNDUS: my Windows Machine, with QuadCore Inteli5, 50GB HDD, 8GB RAM.
- ATHYRIUS: my LINUX Laptop (ArchLinux,btw), with OctaCore Inteli5, 1TB HDD, 8GB RAM
- OBLIVION: my RASPBERRY PI 4B Server (RaspbianOS), with QuadCore ARM processor, 64GB sd-card, 4GB RAM,
- and few VirtualMachines in HardDisks

I have been writing code since, my IX grade, but my actual journey towards Programming began through Freshman Year of my B.Tech Journey. Currently, I am persuing Sophomore Year of B.Tech (S.Y.B.Tech). I have experience in OpenSource Community, and am a member of Neocites.org and contributed in RSS Feed, against BLOTED INTERNET. Moreover, I have been active user of Github Community also.

I am persuing II-Year UnderGraduate Electronics and Telecommunication from Vishwakarma Institute of Tecnology, Pune.
