## ✅  Now discuss, Today's Topic. {Is Internet Curbing Creativity} :-- 

So, by my thoughts this line is fully correct. Now a days Internet is Curbing Creativity.

It is also curbing the ideology of the human beings.

The people are fully depending on the Internet. It is also very harmful for children as well. Now a days, children are not showing attention in their studies by own. They directly go the browser and search their topic and fully copy paste it. By this, their mind is not growing up. They mostly use to complete their HomeWorks, Artworks, Various Projects and some of the students see bad things on Internet. So this thing harms so much on Student's Mind as well as its overall performance.

Their is also a big issue of Internet that is Gaming. Students are not paying attention to their studies, while they spend more of their time in playing games. 

I does not want to say Playing Game is a bad thing. But, it is good until if you are playing in a particular time.

Most of the people look towards the internet for easy solution and correct solution of any answers, without giving the time to the question or racking or using their brains for it. This easiest way of doings things is a serious threat to our Learning, Understanding and Thinking Capacity. 

Not all the Information posted on the Internet is correct.  By this some of the people gain wrong information regarding any particular topic which is a worstful part of an Internet.

There is a lot of Information on Internet. You can also use this to create an amazing project, but without giving of your own effort, it is totally waste. Because this thing makes your mind to always take help from Internet or somebody else. 

Students thinks that copying the solution of any problem, saves time but they does not know that after some years how it is disadvantageous for their mind.
