## Why Dynamic island ?

In place of the notch that Apple first introduced in 2017, there is now Dynamic Island. It is a cutout in the shape of a pill that can change its size and shape to show alerts and notifications.

➡ **With  Notch: **

- It occupies less screen real estate on the iPhone.

- Minimising distractions while watching films or playing games. 

- It is well known. Since 2017, the notch has served as an iconic feature of the iPhone, making it simple to recognise. 

---

## ✅Argument in favour of Dynamic Island: 

- `It looks nicer.`

- The screen seems larger when there is a thin space between the cuts and the bezel. 

- Dynamic Island is a dynamic and practical component. For supporting Face ID unlock animations, lock and charge status, and much more, it extends and changes shape. 
When unlocked, it displays an active task, such as a widget for a music player or quick access to the controls for a voice recorder. 

- Apple's apps make speedy multitasking easier. Because it is a helpful component, third-party apps may use it for some of their purposes. `This makes practically the entire iPhone display area functional.`

## ❌Drawbacks😕

- The drawback is that it occupies more room in the viewfinder or when watching films.

- A lot of fingerprints will be on the front-facing camera.
- Users will frequently touch in front of the front-facing camera that is built into the dynamic island.

- There's a chance that dynamic Island material won't be accessible
-  For instance, it may be difficult to identify the album cover in the picture below.

# ✅Conclusion : 

Apple did an excellent job at getting media attention for this design choice.

➡**This choice was wise from a marketing perspective, as evidenced by the fact that even two weeks after the presentation, many people are still talking about it and we are discussing it here.**

It's encouraging to observe some UI evolution. 👍

The dynamic island and certain folding interface-shifting elements are intriguing and give the field the impression that there is yet more to discover there.
